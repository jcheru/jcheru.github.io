_Disclaimer: While there is research done on this post, I'm still very uninformed on this topic (and most things, tbh)_

If you're trying to win an NBA game, rebounding is important. I don't think anybody would argue that. But the way that we try to record rebounds in the box score has turned it into something that is imprecise, messy, and often overvalued. I would go so far as to say that the number that shows up next to a player's name in the box score means almost nothing to me.

I'm going to explain my grips by looking at just one specific performance: [Russell Westbrook's 16 rebound game vs the Bucks on opening night.](https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401160657) This game has an example of everything that irks me about how we count rebounds. I have nothing against Westbrook specifically, as the things I'm outlining here are common amongst all players in the league.

## Uncontested rebounds 

Rebounds where no opposing player is attempting to collect the ball. These are everywhere.

No Buck is even in the key on his first three boards:

There's a couple of Bucks in the area here, but they're sealed off and Westbrook collects easily:

Another easy one:

Great job out-jumping Austin Rivers on this one:

Doesn't even have to jump here:

And the last one, his 16th of the night:

I see so many of these in every game I watch. I get that they are important - the defensive possession has to end, and somebody has to collect the ball. But my issues is that _anyone_ can collect the ball on these. There's nothing special about Westbrook's ability that makes him more able to collect these. Put any NBA player in these situations and they'll all be able to pull of these down without any issues.

## Tipped out rebounds

These are rebounds where a player under the basket tips / swats the ball away from the basket for another teammate to secure. 

Here's the one example from Westbrook's game. It isn't the best example of what I'm talking about, since the tip out wasn't as controlled as others. Still, Harden is the one battling with the defender for the ball, but Westbrook gets the stat mostly just by happening to be in the area:

Similar thing happens here with Capela:

The statkeeping for these is a bit arbitrary. Tyson Chandler is a master of these [(check out this compilation by FiveThrityEight)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TysonTapbacks.mp4?_=5), and he's confirmed that the person securing the board often gets credited on the stat sheet. I get the argument for giving it to the player securing the ball - they're the ones actually finishing the play. But it just seems like the player battling for the ball is the one doing the dirty work, while the "rebounder" gets the benefit for doing little more than being in the right place at the right time.

## Weird, messy plays that count as rebounds

There are a lot of chaotic plays in basketball. These plays never follow any kind of routine, but they do eventually end. And once it's over, the scorers have to turn that chaos into something discrete on the box score. It isn't always easy.

Check out this play from the game. It looks like PJ Tucker corralls the rebound and slings it to an unaware Westbrook. Once he realizes what happens, Westbrook runs after the ball and tries to save it by tossing it back to Tucker. However, Giannis is there to intercept it and he goes to score.

Westbrook got the credit for a rebound on this play, while Tucker credit for a turnover. I don't really get it. But I guess these things are bound to happen.
