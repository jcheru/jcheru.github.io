My brain has a secret corner reserved for players like Luke Ridnour, Charlie Villanueva, and our boy Thaddeus Young. They were / are half-decent role players on basketball teams. If I happened to tune into these games, these players were usually on the court long enough to make some kind of impact. I would occasionally notice something here or there and think something like "Wow, Luke Rindour has a pretty good mid-range jumper." And that would be it.
