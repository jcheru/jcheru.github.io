## An ode to Thaddeus Young and cherry picked stats

On February 28 2018, Fox Sports Indiana showed this graphic on their broadcast:

This image is objectively beautiful. If you don't like it, you're wrong.

My brain has a secret corner reserved for players like Luke Ridnour, Charlie Villanueva, and our boy Thaddeus Young. They were / are half-decent role players on basketball teams. If I happened to tune into their games, these players were usually on the court long enough to make some kind of impact. I would occasionally notice something here or there and think something like "Huh, Luke Rindour has a pretty good mid-range jumper." And that would be it. I would turn off the game and go about the rest of my day as a wholly unchanged man. But after all these years of watching these random NBA games with random NBA players, these minor role players have managed to carve out a home in my brain. So now, I can hear the name "Thaddeus Young" and I can associate him with the phrases "pretty good defender" and "was on the sixers."

What I'm trying to say is this: Thaddeus Young isn't special. He's just a dude. He's not a bad NBA player by any stretch. But I can guarantee you that this graphic was the only time that he has or ever will be compared to to Magic, Larry, Michael, or Lebron. 

And the comparison is legally allowed to happen, all because of those numbers on top.
