## An ode to Thaddeus Young and cherry picked stats

On February 28 2018, Fox Sports Indiana showed this graphic on their broadcast:

This image is objectively beautiful. If you don't like it, you're wrong.

My brain has a secret corner reserved for players like Luke Ridnour, Charlie Villanueva, and our boy Thaddeus Young. They were / are half-decent role players on basketball teams. If I happened to tune into their games, these players were usually on the court long enough to make some kind of impact. I would occasionally notice something here or there and think something like "Wow, Luke Rindour has a pretty good mid-range jumper." And that would be it. I would turn off the game and go about the rest of my day as a wholly unchanged man. But after all these years of watching these random NBA games with random NBA players, these minor role players have managed to carve out a home in my brain. So now, I can hear the n name "Thaddeus Young" and I can associate those words with "76ers," "pretty good defender"
