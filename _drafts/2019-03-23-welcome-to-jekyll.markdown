_Disclaimer: While there is research done on this post, I'm still very uninformed on this topic (and most things, tbh)_

If you're trying to win an NBA game, rebounding is important. I don't think anybody would argue that. But the way that we try to record rebounds in the box score has turned it into something that is imprecise, messy, and often overvalued. I would go so far as to say that the number that shows up next to a player's name in the box score means almost nothing to me.

I'm going to explain my grips by looking at just one specific performance: [Russell Westbrook's 16 rebound game vs the Bucks on opening night.](https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401160657) This game has an example of everything that irks me about how we count rebounds. I have nothing against Westbrook specifically, as the things I'm outlining here are common amongst all players in the league.

## Uncontested rebounds 

These are everywhere. 

No Buck is even in the key on his first three boards:

There's a couple of Bucks in the area here, but they're sealed off and Westbrook collects easily:

Great job out-jumping Austin Rivers on this one:

Doesn't even have to jump here:

And the last one, his 16th of the night:

I see so many of these in every game I watch.
