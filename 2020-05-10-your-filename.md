<p>On February 28 2018, Fox Sports Indiana showed this graphic on their broadcast:</p>

This image is objectively beautiful. If you don’t like it, you’re wrong.</p>
<p>My brain has a secret corner reserved for players like Luke Ridnour, Charlie Villanueva, and our boy Thaddeus Young. They were / are half-decent role players on basketball teams. If I happened to tune into their games, these players were usually on the court long enough to make some kind of impact. I would occasionally notice something here or there and think something like “Huh, Luke Rindour has a pretty good mid-range jumper.” And that would be it. I would turn off the game and go about the rest of my day as a wholly unchanged man. But after all these years of watching these random NBA games with random NBA players, these minor role players have managed to carve out a home in my brain. So now, I can hear the name “Thaddeus Young” and I can associate him with the phrases “pretty good defender” and “was on the sixers.”</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is this: Thaddeus Young isn’t special. He’s just a dude. He’s not a bad NBA player by any stretch. But I can guarantee you that this graphic was the only time that he has or ever will be compared to to Magic, Larry, Michael, or Lebron.</p>
<p>And the comparison is legally allowed to happen, all because of those numbers on top. You can get annoyed all you want, but you can’t dispute the numbers. You can’t argue with a calculator.</p>
<p>But if you want to over-analyze this stuff and get philosophical about it, you could ask the following: what is the point of statistics if they are going to be so blatantly ridiculous and borderline immoral?</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of what I’m talking about:</p>

The criteria is so selective, so arbitrary, so unnatural, that you just can’t help but laugh. If the question is “what is the point?”, then the answer is “there is no point.” I’ve spent most of my life with the understanding that the objectiveness of numbers help us understanding something abstract, like basketball. But that isn’t always the case. Sometimes, numbers just exist without a purpose. Sometimes an ESPN employee just has some down time, a database full of numbers, and a newfound interest in SQL joins. These numbers don’t have any hidden agenda or greater takeaway. They aren’t here to teach you anything. They are just here to exist, the same way you are here on this Earth to exist.</p>
<p>I think the stats guy at Fox Sports Indiana really understands this concept. Somehow, he came up with this gem of statistic, got the graphics guys to buy in, and convinced his manager to broadcast it. He realized that behind the ugliness of those decimal places and non-rounded numbers, there was inherent beauty. And on that fateful night in late February, the stats guy got to show his masterpiece to the world. He caused a little bit of a <a href="https://twitter.com/FSIndiana/status/969012390158262272">stir on twitter that night</a>, got <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2762113-tv-graphic-places-thaddeus-young-alongside-all-time-nba-legends">a few articles written about him</a>, but that was pretty much it. The Pacers lost that game to the 19-43 Hawks. Nobody remembers a single thing about that game. But that day will go down in history as the only time that anybody was able to compare Thaddeus Young to Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Lebron James, and actually get away with it. An incredible accomplishment. It just goes to show you that once you realize that nothing really truly matters - not sports, not numbers, not life - that’s when you can truly achieve greatness.</p>
